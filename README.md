In the html file we are using Bootstrap and foundation CDN. We used Bootstrap for the Nav as well as for the carousel and foundation was used for the Search Bar. A div with id of carouselExampleControls was created to show entire gallery. A tags were created to enable images to go left/next or right/previous. We used four script files, one for jquery, one for foundation, one for bootstrap, and our script the api.js.
